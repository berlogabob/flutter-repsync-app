# Metronome Sounds

Place metronome sound files here:
- `metronome_click.mp3` - Regular beat sound
- `metronome_accent.mp3` - Accented beat (first beat of measure)

You can generate these sounds using:
1. Online metronome sound generators
2. Audio editing software
3. Free sound libraries

For now, the metronome will work with silent fallback if sounds are missing.
